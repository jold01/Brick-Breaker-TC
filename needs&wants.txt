Premise of Game: The game will act similarly to brick breaker clones, but
will instead change the color of each brick the ball hits, vs destroying
the brick.

It will be a multiplayer game that will be 2 v 2.
Each player will have their own color. When the ball hits the player's
paddle, the ball will become the player's color. When the ball touches
the brick, the brick will change to be the same color as the ball. The goal
of the game is to have as many bricks to be your color within the time
limit.

The time limit will be 15 seconds per round. At the end of the round,
whoever has more bricks their color, will earn a point. After a set
limiter of points, a player wins.

NEEDS:

-Online multiplayer support.
-A timer for rounds
-A counter for counting point amounts
-A win condition
-Basic graphics for the actually game
-At least one play field to play on

WANTS:

-Controller configurer
-Sound effects
-Custom graphics and splash screens
-Power-ups(hitting "special bricks that cause things to change. ie longer 
paddle, ball increases speed, etc.)
-Custom brick layout editor program that streamlines the production of
player fields.
